# Static Resource Dashboard

This repository hosts a static dashboard with pages for resources, events
and FAQs. Everything is bundled as plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript so no
backend is required.

## Viewing the pages

Open `index.html` in your web browser to start browsing. You can simply
doubleâ€‘click the file or serve the folder with any static file server.
Other pages such as `events.html`, `faq.html` and `glossary.html` may also
be opened directly.
